TODO:
* implement "hide" button that uses the same icon as remove
* better error reporting

NOTE:
* visibility: true makes elements hidden, but the elements still take up space.  While display: none, makes them hidden and they don't take up space.
* in backbone.js, all model events fire on the collections they belong to.  Keep in mind tho, that if you specify wait: true, then the model will not get added to the collection on error.

TODO:
* increase remember time
