I need to complete all of the quick fixes, before I move onto any one of the enhancements.

Quick Fixes(for tonight):
- ability to up/downvote posts

- I click "control groups".  I expect the second nav to show "control groups" now
- have group follows organized by last access.  this way the most recently accessed group is always on the left

- Avatar tipsy tips do not work upon search for groups
- turn off markdown.  We need to selectively turn things on as we want them.  Leave in code syntax highlighting.
Also add the possiblity for admins to edit things
- condensed group falls below the solution line on posts with only a single line of description text
- kick over the second comment under a top tier comment
- large avatar on post isn't clickable
- hover states for the subnav on the profile page
- hover states for the usernames in condensed posts
- Show when a search returns an empty set somehow
- number of comments on each condensed post should show the total number of comments

Enhancements:
- uploads do not maintain their order
- When you are viewing a group, it should always appear in the subnav, even if you are not following it
- A member list page for each group.  Form of roster
- Permission organization.  Admins should be able to edit everything on the site.
- groups page needs to have more options for filtering.  It should be a gateway to all the groups
in your network.
- feed of activity
- activity for each user, personal feed so to speak
- notification feed
- Additional profile information.  Phone number, e-mail, majors, etc
- scroll to the top button
- verify e-mail
- see who is following me
- put some kind of week system in place, where posts are organized by the week they took place
- support tags
- facebook/twitter integration
- live updates
- maybe make tipsy tips more localized.  So it gets run every time a small unit is created, like a condensed group for example
- support very long usernames

Re-designs:
- condensed posts.  Need to accommodate for post score, attachments, number of saves, time posted, group posted into
- need to rethink how the groups subnav is done.  Needs to include a follow button, and metadata about the group
- The subnav should be the same regardless of

Brainstorm on user search
- maybe have a small condensed profile element, that has the main profile pic, and basic user info.
- condensed profile shows what groups the user is in

- start using exclusively red for icons, and the light twitter blue for text


Coversation with Josh:
What do people post in posts
have a header always show you what post your on
