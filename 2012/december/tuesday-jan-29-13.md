1. When a comment it added to a post and then deleted, the comment counter on the post doesn't subtract or
   update the number of posts that are in the comment. For instant I made one comment, deleted it, refreshed
   the page a few times and it still read a 1 in the comment counter on the bottom right of the post.
   Also, the comment counter on my profile page still reads 1 after I deleted my comment on a post. Should read 0 after I deleted it.

2.When selecting a group from the subnav where are the classes are at it highlights what class your on, I like this, it works well. However
  when you have enough classes to fill the subnav bar you can always see the highlighted class that is farther to the right than the page subnav displays. I think that after you
  load a group page the subnav should stay at the last place you scrolled to on it so that it displays the group page your on (basically have the subnav show the highlighted group your
  on without having to manually scroll over to it when you travel to a new page.)

3.I noticed that the "last online" time indicator on the profile page doesn't update after you sign off and sign back on. It just displays how long ago since I registered for the website.

4. I think the "save" hearts on the posts should turn red when you save a post because the contrast between the grey heart and black heart is hard to see right away. Its hard to tell if you saved the post or not.

5. I also think you should be able to like the posts that people make as well as their comments, which you can already do.

6. Maybe add a "Posts" counter to the user profile page as well

7. I think there should also be a way to view who is in the group without them having to post something in there to visit their profile. There may be a way to do
   that now but its not obvious. I would like some kind of "roster" or list of users who are in the group so I can see who all I can address. Maybe even at some
   point tag that user in a post.

8. I still think there should be something on the screen that tells you what group page you are on when you're not following that group. So if I visit a page from
   the list of groups that Im not currently following it will show me somewhere that it is indeed that groups wall. The only way that you can do that now is by looking
   at what group is highlighted in the subnav bar, but you have to be following that group to do so.

9. There is still no way to follow a group if you are in that groups page. You can do so if you search the group, but you cant from inside the groups page.

10. I think it would be helpful if the text in the search field up at the top of the screen said "search for posts..." when you are on the posts page, and "search for groups..."
    when you are on the groups page, because you can only search for posts on the post page and only search for groups on the groups page as of right now

Andrew's comments:
- Page that enumerates all of the groups
- Postgres partial word search
- I want a feed.
- I click "control groups".  I expect the second nav to show "control groups" now

- Avatar tipsy tips do not work upon search for groups
- upboats for posts
- turn off markdown.  We need to selectively turn things on as we want them.  Leave in code syntax highlighting.  Also add the possiblity for admins to edit things
- condensed group falls below the solution line on posts with on ly a single line of description text
- kick over the second comment under a top tier comment
- Additional profile information.  Phone number, e-mail, majors, etc
- large avatar on post isn't clickable
- have group follows organized by last access.  this way the most recently accessed group is always on the left
- hover states for the subnav on the profile page
- hover states for the usernames in posts
- Show when a search returns an empty set somehow
- scroll to the top button
- activity for each user, personal feed so to speak
- verify e-mail
- make it more obvious who the members of the group are
- uploads do not maintain their order
- number of comments on each condensed post should show the total number of comments

UI Enhancements
- see who is following me
- put some kind of week system in place, where posts are organized by the week they took place
- support tags

Brainstorm on user search
- maybe have a small condensed profile element, that has the main profile pic, and basic user info.
- condensed post shows what groups the user is in
