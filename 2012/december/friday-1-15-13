Lock feature in underscore?

TODO:
- Put beta in logo, so it is completely obvious
- Have a method of retrieving a username
- when you have a group selected, you need to be able to click post and the group will
automagically get selected.

- Come up with a variety of different functions, such as get_user_by_email, get_user_by_username, etc.  So
that way there is a single method of retrieval for all of those types of elements.  Far easier to modify

- Add a link to the comment from the email notification
